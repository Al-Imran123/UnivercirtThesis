                <p>
                    The website located at http://www.99designs.com/ (the “Site”) is a copyrighted work belonging to 99designs Pty Ltd, Australian Company Number 121 195 248 (“99designs”, “us”, and “we”). Certain features of the Services or Site may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Service or Site in connection with such features. To the extent such terms, guidelines, and rules conflict with these terms of use, these terms of use shall govern.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Payment Terms.</h2>
                <p>The following terms apply to Customers who have purchased a Sold Design and Designers who have sold a Sold Design.</p>

                <h2>2. Payment and Delivery.</h2>
                <p>For the Design Contest, (a) Customer will pay the Customer Payment to 99designs and 99designs will pay Designer the Designer Fee (subject to first receiving payment from Customer), and (b) Designer will upload the Sold Design and 99designs will deliver the Sold Design to Customer, in a format specified by 99designs. For the Project Services, (1) Designer will upload the Design and if Customer accepts the Design as described above, then (2) Customer will pay the Customer Payment and 99designs will pay Designer the Designer Fee (subject to first receiving payment from Customer). The “Customer Payment” means (i) the price selected by Customer when Customer created a Design Contest as set forth at http://99designs.com/pricing; or (ii) the invoiced price for the Sold Design issued through the Project Service by Designer to Customer. The “Designer Fee” means the Customer Payment, minus the fees and charges imposed by 99designs as set forth at http://help.99designs.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1554727-how-much-does-1-to-1-projects-cost and minus any applicable Taxes.</p>

                <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
                <p>Refunds will be paid to Customer using the same payment methods Customer used to remit the Customer Payment to 99designs or via any other method specified by 99designs from time to time. If a refund is paid to Customer or a credit card charge back occurs, then: (a) Designer must reimburse 99designs for the applicable Designer Fee (the reimbursement will first be paid out of any 99designs Credits held by Designer and any remaining debt will be payable by Designer to 99designs on demand); and (b) Customer will initially receive the amount of the Customer Payment, less the Designer Fee and will receive the Designer Fee only once the Designer Fee is reimbursed by Designer to 99designs. 99designs may refund Customers for the following reasons: (i) the Sold Design is Defective; (ii) 99designs is required by law or considers that it is required by law to do so; (iii) 99designs determines that issuing a refund to Customer will avoid any dispute or increased costs to 99designs; (iv) 99designs issues the refund to Customer in accordance with any refund policy specified by 99designs from time to time; (v) the order placed (or request made) by Customer is found to be fraudulent; (vi) Customer placed a duplicate order (or request) in error; or (vii) in 99designs’ sole opinion, 99designs considers that it is likely that the refund is necessary to avoid a credit card charge back. A Sold Design will be deemed to be “Defective” if: (i) Customer and Designer agree it is defective and notify 99designs of this fact; (ii) the Sold Design is subject to a third party claim that the Sold Design infringes/misappropriates such party’s IPR, that is not frivolous.</p>
